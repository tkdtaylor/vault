"""PreCompact hook — block compaction until the agent checkpoints progress.

When Claude's context window is about to be compacted, this hook checks
whether there is unsaved work (uncommitted changes). If so, it blocks
compaction and instructs the agent to commit first.

This complements post-compact.py (which re-injects context after compaction)
as a belt-and-suspenders approach: pre-compact saves working memory,
post-compact re-injects known state.

Inspired by awrshift/claude-memory-kit.
